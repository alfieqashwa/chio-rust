# Chio Rust

## Learning Rust Again

The repository is a collection of files that summarize my learning journey with Rust. Each file corresponds to a specific topic or concept in Rust, and the naming convention follows a simple pattern: `00-vars`, `01-strings`, etc.

### Running the Code

```bash
cargo run 00-vars
```
